     <p>Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and backend; so, the full-stack of technology that makes up a website.
        They are proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments.
        To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in a variety of different roles. 
        They also tend to be well-versed in both business logic and user experience, meaning they are 
        not only well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.
        If you’d like to look more closely at the range of skills required to make it, check out our guide to full-stack developer skills.

        <p>It’s been said that smelling roses before sleeping has been said to promote lovely dreams,
             while the scent of rotten eggs, unsurprisingly, does the opposite result.
              Smells have an effect on us in our waking time and are equally potent when we are asleep.
               While you’ll want to avoid unpleasant odors before going to bed,
                if a certain scent makes you feel great,
                 smell it just before going to sleep or have an aromatherapy infuser running while you are sleeping. 
            It can’t hurt and could produce a pleasant dream!</p>
